/* ── ONE RULE LIST, THREE CONSUMERS ──
 *
 * A rule stated in prose and checked by nothing does not land. Four faults in
 * one simulated build proved it: three of them had a precise rule in DESIGN.md
 * and no line in the contract's checklist, so the builder read past them.
 *
 *   the table's first cell sat 8px inside the card's own margin  (DESIGN.md)
 *   the alert's action sat 9px off the message's baseline        (DESIGN.md)
 *   the toggle carried no `aria-pressed` and a bare label        (DESIGN.md)
 *
 * So the checklist and the shipped verifiers now come from this one array.
 * `agents.js` renders `line`. `verify.js` renders `body` into whichever file
 * the `where` names. A rule added here appears in all three, and a rule cannot
 * be worded one way in the contract and coded another way in the tool.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BODIES ARE STRINGS ──
 *
 * The obvious version keeps them as functions and calls `.toString()`. The
 * payload is built in the browser from a minified bundle, so that emits
 * mangled one-liners into a file whose whole purpose is to be read and
 * trusted. Lines of source survive the build byte for byte.
 *
 * NO BACKTICK MAY APPEAR IN A BODY. These lines are joined into a template
 * literal in `verify.js`; one backtick there ends the string and the rest of
 * the file parses as expressions. That is the trap this project keeps hitting,
 * and `no-backtick-in-a-body` below is asserted by the test suite.
 */

/* `where`:
 *   source — runs in Node over the files the agent wrote
 *   render — runs in the browser over the page the agent built
 *   manual — no machine can answer it; it stays a line in the checklist

    /* ── A PUBLISHED RULE WITH NO CHECK, FOUND BY A BUILD THAT PASSED ──
     *
     * This system states that an amount takes the mono face AND an end edge,
     * and that the edge is the half that lines the magnitudes up. Nothing
     * measured the edge. A generated dashboard shipped four amounts in one
     * column whose right edges read 773, 763, 763 and 773, through a clean
     * source pass and a clean render pass.
     *
     * The cause was ordinary. A single class at (0,1,0) lost to the base cell
     * rule at (0,1,1), so the alignment it declared never applied.
     *
     * ASK THE COLUMN, NOT THE CELL. One cell has nothing to line up with. So
     * the check gathers a table's body cells by index and compares the ink.
     *
     * AN AMOUNT IS NOT EVERY FIGURE, and getting that wrong makes the check
     * useless. An identifier is set in the same mono face and is deliberately
     * NOT moved to the end, because nobody compares its magnitude. A bare run
     * of digits is ambiguous: 10023 is an order number or a quantity, and the
     * text cannot say which. So the check asks for a MARK — a separator, a
     * decimal, a currency symbol, a sign, or a percent. An amount carries one.
     * An identifier does not. A column of bare integers is skipped, which is a
     * miss rather than a false positive, and that is the safe direction.
     *
     * THE THRESHOLD IS ON THE MOVE. Lining a column up moves each value by the
     * whole difference, not half of it, so 1px here is 1px of repair.
     *
     * THE SECOND HALF IS THE ONE THAT DOES NOT SHOW YET. A column of equal-
     * width values lines up whatever its alignment, because every digit in a
     * mono face is one width. It looks correct and breaks the day a value
     * gains a digit. So when the edges agree AND every value is the same
     * width AND nothing declares an end alignment, say so. Different widths
     * with agreeing edges means something really is aligning them, and that
     * case stays silent. */

   * ornament gap against the container's own padding.
   *

   * invented, because `--cmp-badge-gap` did not exist to be used.
   *

   * gap for every component that can hold a mark beside a label, and
   * `tools/component-gaps-guard.mjs` fails the build if one stops doing so.

     *
     * A ROW, NEVER A COLUMN. `nowrap` is the default, so a flex COLUMN matches
     * it too, and there the union across vertically stacked children measures
     * the widest child rather than a line that will not fit. Pointed at a
     * correct app it faulted a form column 34px wide of its own box, where

     *
     * "An action row moves below its heading" was a MANUAL line, so nothing
     * ran it, and the fault it prevents is exactly measurable.
     *
     * A heading beside an action row in a grid whose title track is
     * minmax(0, 1fr) has a ZERO floor. So the track collapses instead of the
     * row breaking, and the heading is left to wrap inside nothing. Measured
     * on a generated dashboard at a 390px viewport: the title box came out
     * 0 by 280 pixels, one word over EIGHT lines, against its own min-content
     * width of 108. The columns read 0px and 330px.
     *
     * Two questions, both exact. More lines than words means a word broke, and
     * a heading never breaks mid-word. A box narrower than the text inside it
     * means a track with no floor took the room.
     *
     * Nothing else saw it. The page did not overflow, because the heading gave
     * way instead. */

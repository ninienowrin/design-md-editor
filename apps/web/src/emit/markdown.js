Measured: a menu button declared `display: none` ninety lines below its own container query, so it never appeared at any width, and a narrow page had no rail and no menu at all. Put every breakpoint and container block AFTER the base rules, at the end of the stylesheet.',

So the declaration reads like the fix and is ignored, and the items stay where `align-items` put them. Measured on a nav item holding the 44px touch floor: the label packed to the top of a 44px box, which reads as an oddly tall selection with its contents in a corner. Either add `flex-wrap: wrap`, which gives the property a line to centre, or centre the items instead.',
      '**A SCROLLER CANNOT CLAMP UNTIL EVERY ANCESTOR IS FLOORED.** A flex or grid child defaults to `min-width: auto`, so its box grows to its content and the `overflow-x` inside it never engages. Measured at a 320px viewport: a table rendered 572px wide, the page came to 497, and nothing scrolled inside its own box. Put `min-width: 0` on every box between the scroller and the page, not only on the one that holds it.',

Centre the box in it and the first column paints its mark well inside the margin every heading, count and range in the panel sits on. Measured from a card own start edge: the title, the selection count and the pager range all at 13px, and the checkbox at 27px. A check on the CELL cannot see it, because the cell was on the margin and the painted mark was not. Give an outer column start alignment and let the area extend away from the edge.',
      'Anything left alone on its own line takes the whole line. A wrap, a fold or a hidden label orphans an element often. The orphan almost never resizes itself. A 150px field floating in a 351px row then reads as an accident, not a decision.',

      '**A GROUP LABEL OWNS THE DISTANCE TO WHAT IT NAMES, AND A BARE BLOCK OWNS NOTHING.** An overline above a list is two block siblings, and blocks carry no gap of their own. Measured on a generated rail: a "Ledger" label sat 0.00px above the first navigation item, so the label read as a dead first row of the list rather than as its name. A flex parent with a `gap` fixes the whole group at once; a `margin-bottom` on the label fixes only where somebody remembered it. Give the label at least the `sm` step, and keep it under the step between one group and the next, or the label joins the group above.',
      'That floor is what decides when the row breaks. The question is never "do the actions still fit" — it is "do they still fit with that gap intact". A row that fits only by letting the title and the first button close up has already failed. Move the actions below the heading at the width where the gap would drop under the floor, not at the width where the buttons would finally overlap.',

      '**An ODD number of actions gives the most important one a full-width line to itself.** It goes first, at the top. In a row the primary reads last because the eye ends there; in a column the top line is the one that gets pressed. That leaves an even number to pair up below it. An EVEN number needs no such line and pairs straight away.',
      '**The rest go TWO PER LINE, equal, covering the whole width.** Each takes half the line, so every line starts and ends on the same two edges as the first — a ragged line reads as a wrap that got away rather than as a decision. Where one label is longer than its half, it takes the width it needs and its partner shrinks into what is left. Where BOTH labels are too long to share, each takes its own line at full width.',
      '**Build the pair as its own container, holding two buttons.** Two per line and "one stretches, the other shrinks" cannot both come out of one flex row. Give every button in a row `flex: 1 1 0` and the count per line is decided by the labels rather than by you — five buttons come out one, then three, then one. Give them a 50% basis instead and a `min-content` floor pushes the two bases past the line, so the row wraps rather than shrinking the partner, and one long label renders the same as two. With two children in their own container, growth splits between exactly two. Each button then takes `flex: 1 1 0` and `min-width: min-content`. Measured on a 370px row: 49/49 with both short, 58/40 with one long, 100/100 on two lines with both long.',

      /* ── THE THIRD CASE NEEDS ONE MORE DECLARATION, AND IT WAS MISSING ──
       *
       * The rule above promises "100/100 on two lines with both long" and
       * never says how the pair reaches a second line. A flex container does
       * not wrap by default, so with both labels too long the pair simply
       * overflows its row.
       *

       * came out 341px inside a 280px row, on one line, and pushed the page
       * 42px sideways. The primary button was cut off at the screen edge.
       * `flex-wrap: wrap` on the pair took it to 280px, two lines, 280 and
       * 280, and zero overflow.
       *
       * It costs nothing in the other two cases, because a container only
       * wraps once its contents genuinely do not fit. Re-measured at 370px
       * with wrap on: 49/49 with both short and 39/60 with one long, both on
       * one line. */
      '**AND THE PAIR WRAPS, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY IT REACHES A SECOND LINE.** A flex container does not wrap by default, so a pair holding two labels that are each too long for half the row overflows instead of stacking. `white-space: nowrap` on a button means neither one can shrink below its own label, so nothing else can give. Put `flex-wrap: wrap` on the pair. Measured at a 320px viewport: without it the pair came out 341px inside a 280px row and pushed the page 42px sideways, with the primary cut off at the screen edge. With it the pair is 280px over two lines at 280 and 280, and the page does not scroll. It changes nothing at a width where the two fit.',
      '**Dissolve the pairs at any width where the row fits on one line.** `display: contents` on each pair promotes every button into the single row, at natural widths. The pairing is what a row does when it breaks, not a permanent structure.',
      '**An auto margin does not create space; it takes what the line already has.** A button held against the END edge by `margin-inline-start: auto` needs free space on its own line to consume. Put the buttons inside a box that shrink-wraps them and there is none, so the margin resolves to zero while the bar still has room — measured at 0px against 618.6px of empty bar. Nothing reports it: the margin is declared, computed style agrees it is zero, and the button simply sits in the wrong place. Give that box `flex: 1` so the slack falls inside it.',

Three of them measured 47px from their padding against a 44px floor, and the row needed 359.1px in a 351px bar. At 44 it comes to 350.1 and fits. The floor is a value the system publishes with a reason; a gap cut to 6px is a number invented at the moment of the problem.',
      'Never render an empty box that grows. Where every child of a group is hidden at some width, do not render the group — an empty flex child with `flex-grow` claims the free space, paints nothing, and pushes real content around.

It appears the first time a restructure lets that group empty out, so re-check a container after moving anything out of it.',

Written out again per row, an intrinsic track such as `max-content` resolves against that row alone — measured, a header row sized its label column to the word "Feature" while the rows below sized theirs to "Automatic chasing", and the three value columns missed their own headings by 44.1, 26.5 and 8.9px. Nothing overflowed, so no check objected. Keep the repeated list as a fallback under `@supports`, so a browser without subgrid renders a comparison that is slightly out rather than one column of everything.',

Draw it as a background image instead, which can be inset where a border cannot — a 1px gradient sized to the cell width minus 2px and placed 1px in stops short of both edges, so the divider crosses the column and the vertical line stays whole. This is safe because a marked column carries no fill; it is marked by its edge.',

A gap is space belonging to no cell, so nothing can paint across it: with the divider on the cells, every row rule broke into three pieces with a 16px hole at each track boundary. Set the column gap to zero and put the separation inside each cell as padding. Padding on a cell is safe because it sits within the track and moves nothing; only padding on the ROW shifts the track list and breaks the alignment between rows.',
      'Beware of fixing a seam by moving what draws it, because the seam can simply move too. Taking the divider off the row and onto the cells turned a vertical break into a horizontal one. Ask what the empty space between the two parts actually is — here it was the column gap — and remove the cause rather than reassigning the symptom.',

         its page and would not have on a bigger title. This one now names the

         a judgement call. */

      'Page actions belong to the heading, not to the heading-and-description block. Align them to the heading itself. Which alignment depends on the size difference: share a baseline while the heading is under one and a half times the control\'s font size, and centre the two once it is over that. **CENTRE MEANS ON THE HEADING\'S CAP BAND, NEVER ON ITS LINE BOX.** The two lines are the top of a capital letter and the baseline the letters sit on, exactly as for an icon beside a label. A heading\'s line box is far taller than that band, because it carries the leading and the descender space the capitals never use — so `align-items: center` on the row lands the control below the letters, measured 12.5px low on a 40px title. Centre the control\'s BOX between those two lines and let it overhang both equally, which is what centred means. Never pin the actions to the top of the band with `align-items: flex-start` — that leaves them floating above a title whose letters sit well below them.',

      '**THE SELECTION COLUMN IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT HAS ITS OWN ENTRY.** A column that carries the selected row\'s accent bar cannot also sit flush, because the bar would paint over whatever is in the cell. `table-selection-cell` publishes that column\'s padding with the bar\'s gutter already in it. Take it on EVERY row of that column, selected or not, and take `table-cell` for every other column.',
      'Never build an underline from a border. A 2px border makes the element 2px taller and pushes it past its own container\'s rule, breaking that line exactly where the element sits. A *transparent* border costs the same height, so the inactive siblings sit wrong too. Paint it with `box-shadow: inset 0 -2px 0` instead, which lands in the same place and joins no box.',
      '**AND EVERY MARK DRAWN THAT WAY DISAPPEARS IN FORCED COLORS.** Windows High Contrast overrides authored colour, ignores `box-shadow` outright, and drops `background-image`. Three marks in this system are drawn with one of those, and each is a rule stated above: the selected row\'s accent bar, the selected tab\'s underline, and the neutral badge\'s outline. In that mode all three lose their only marker, and the fill cannot cover for them because `background-color` is disregarded as well.\n\n**Restore them with an `outline` at a NEGATIVE offset**, inside `@media (forced-colors: active)`. Forced colors preserves outlines, which is why a focus ring already survives there, and an outline costs no layout. A border would widen the box and move the very column these rules keep straight. Use `Highlight` for a chosen thing and `CanvasText` for a structural edge: those are the user\'s own colours, which is the point of the mode. `tokens.css` ships the block keyed on `aria-current`, `aria-selected` and `aria-checked`. Match your own selectors to it if you mark state with classes instead.',

The section label goes INSIDE the menu, with the links it names, because the label belongs to the menu rather than to the bar. The menu then opens directly under the row that carries the mark, which means the fold has to be a sibling of the title row and not a block further up the page.',
      'Name a screen the way a reader would before measuring it. A reader sees an app bar, a drawer, a card list — patterns they have met before. "A sidebar that has collapsed" describes how a thing was built, not what it is, and every geometric check passes while the arrangement is wrong.',

Correct it with a transform, stated against the heading\'s own size token so it follows the type scale. Do not state it in `em` — on that element `em` resolves against the inherited body size, not the heading\'s. A heading that wraps has no single cap centre at all, so the block rule above applies instead.',
      '**The control that opens a folded navigation is a BUTTON, and it belongs to the action group at the seat furthest along the row.** Not a mark parked against the page title — a control beside a heading reads as part of the heading rather than as something you press. Give it the same shell as every other button in that row: the same height, padding, radius, border and hover. Navigation outranks every action on the page, so nothing may take that last seat from it. Build it as a SIBLING of the action group rather than a member, because a collapsing header keeps this one control on the title\'s row after the others drop to a line of their own — inside the group it can only go where the group goes.',
      '**A header collapses in five stages, and the order of sacrifice is the rule.** The title and the mark that opens the navigation never go. Widest, the navigation is a column beside the page and every action sits on the title\'s row. Then the navigation folds to a mark with its label, at the right of the title. Then the label goes. Then the actions take a line of their own, which hands the label its room back. Then the label goes again. Read it as a priority order rather than five layouts: drop decoration before content, and content before action.',
      '**A collapse threshold is a SUM, not a constant — recompute it for your own content.** Every width in this document was measured from one heading and one set of controls, and a container query cannot measure text, so the numbers here are a worked example rather than a value to copy. The sum is: `threshold = widest item + gap + the control beside it + twice the surface padding`. The reference this document was measured from: heading 163px, labelled menu control 160px, bare control 44px, action group 251px, row gap 8px, surface padding 24px each side. That gives 163 + 8 + 160 + 48 = 379, and the heading starts overflowing just under 380. Substitute your own widths and the same sum gives your own threshold.',
      '**A sum only works on a row with two things in it.** Every threshold here that was added up while the row held three or four items came out 16 to 32px wrong, because a sum misses a gap or a size step. Two things can be added up and four cannot, which is a reason to simplify the row rather than to measure harder.',
      '**Measure a part at the width where it is used.** A control that grows at a breakpoint has two natural widths, and the sum is only true on one side of it.

      '**A title beside its actions takes content width, never the free space.** `width: 100%` puts the actions on a second row at every width. `flex: 1 1 auto` does the same thing quietly, by growing into the room the actions needed. Use `flex: 0 1 auto` and let the title claim the whole line only at the width where the actions are meant to drop.',
      '**A folded menu floats. It never pushes the page down.** Opening it inline moved every word on the screen, which is the thing a floating panel exists to prevent. Take the panel out of the flow, anchor it under the mark that opens it, and give it the overlay elevation — a flat panel reads as text lying on the page rather than a surface above it.',
      '**Two meanings must not be one colour, and contrast cannot tell you.** A ratio measures lightness, so two roles one step apart on a ramp read about 1:1 whatever their hue. Compare OKLCH hue as well: below about 25 degrees the pair says nothing. Ask both questions together, though — a brand and a danger one degree apart in hue but fifteen points apart in lightness ARE distinguishable, and reporting that pair calls a solved problem open.',
      '**A page title keeps every word and takes the lines it needs.** It is the one thing on screen that says where the reader is, so it wraps rather than truncating, and it never breaks mid-word. Measure every collapse threshold from a LONG title rather than a short sample one — a container query cannot measure text, so a threshold tuned to a short heading lets a long one overflow before the layout reacts. A short title then collapses a step early, which nobody notices; an overflow is a defect everybody notices.',
      '**THE CONTROLS ALIGN TO THE HEADING. THE METADATA LINE IS NOT PART OF THAT ROW.** A description, a timestamp or a status line sits BELOW the title and belongs to no row of controls. So a title and its description must not be one flex item: `last baseline` then takes the last line of that item, which is the metadata, and the buttons land level with the small grey line instead of the heading. Measured on a generated dashboard: a 31.78px baseline spread across the row, with the actions 25.78px below the title they belonged to. Give the header named grid areas — the title and the actions on one row, the description on its own underneath — so the actions centre on the title and still take a full line below everything when they stop fitting.',
      '**COUNT WHAT A HEADER ROW HOLDS BEFORE CHOOSING ITS ALIGNMENT.** A heading beside two or three fixed-height controls is a row of CONTROLS, so it centres. On baseline, a button carrying a mark and a button carrying none report baselines 1.75px apart, because the mark is a baseline participant and the label is not the only one. Reach for `align-items: center` on any header row whose controls outnumber its runs of text.',
      '**Controls beside a multi-line title centre on its FIRST LINE, not on the block.** Centred on the block they drift further down with every extra line, and then they read as attached to the paragraph rather than to the heading. Derive the offset from tokens rather than typing it: the first line is `size × leading`, and the control\'s height is its own step. Use the height the control actually has at that width — assuming the small step read 6.08px out where the button was 44 tall.',
      '**"Rightmost" and "stays with the title" cannot both hold in one wrapping row.** Ordered after the action group, a menu control sits last and wraps away with it. Ordered before the group, it keeps the title\'s row and stops being rightmost among the buttons. A short title hides the clash; a long one makes the group wrap early and exposes it. Staying with the title wins, so the action group takes a line of its own whenever the navigation is folded.',
      '**THE MARK IS ONE SIZE AT EVERY BUTTON SIZE.** A button states its box, its padding and its label per size; its icon does not follow. The size is published once, as the button component base, and every size step reads that one value. Do not derive a per-size icon from the label beside it: the alignment rule below centres the mark on the label\'s own cap band at whatever size the mark is, so the step has nothing left to track. Deriving it per size is also how the pairing breaks in practice, because every rule that resizes a button then has to remember to resize a mark, and three of them did not.',
      '**An icon equal to its label crosses the baseline, and that is a SIZE fault fixed once.** The cap band is what a reader compares the mark against, and it is about three quarters of the type size, while the tallest glyphs in an icon set paint nearly their whole box. Measured on a download mark beside a 12px label: 11px of ink in a 9px band, 1.3px below the line. The published mark size already clears this. If you change it, change the one token, never a glyph and never a single size step.',
      '**The icon lives between the CAP LINE and the BASELINE of the label beside it.** Those two lines are the whole vertical rule: the top of a capital letter, and the line the letters sit on. Centre the icon BOX between them, and measure the centring on the box rather than on the ink — the box is what CSS places, and where a glyph sits inside its own viewBox is the icon set’s business. Equal overhang above and below is correct, because that is what centred means. A large equal overhang is a size fault, fixed by taking the icon token down a step and never by moving the glyph.',

       *
       * The rule above states where the mark ends up and left the reader to
       * derive the CSS. Several plausible answers land in different places,
       * and the usual one is `vertical-align: middle`, which is the x-height
       * centre rather than the cap centre. A generated build got there and
       * the mark sank on every button.
       *
       * Every neighbouring rule in this section already ships its mechanism —
       * `:not(.icon-only)` on the selector, `line-height` on an inline-block
       * for avatar initials. This one was the outlier. */
      'Three declarations do the whole job, and none of the three is optional:\n\n```css\nvertical-align: baseline;   /* puts the box BOTTOM edge on the text baseline */\nalign-self: baseline;       /* a flex parent ignores vertical-align */\ntransform: translateY(calc((100% - 0.75em) / 2));\n```\n\nThe percentage resolves against the mark’s OWN height, so one rule holds at every icon size and no per-size table is needed. `0.75em` is the cap height, measured from painted ink at 12, 16, 20 and 24px. Both units resolve on the element carrying the transform, so put the rule on something that inherits the label’s type.',

      '**Two traps go with that formula, and neither is guessable from the result.** `align-self` is not optional: a flex parent ignores `vertical-align` entirely, so a nav item centred its mark on the row box while the button beside it sat on the baseline, measured 0.34 above the cap against 5.66 below. And the ROW must declare `align-items: baseline` as well, because `align-self: baseline` aligns to the flex LINE baseline rather than to the label. Inside a folded menu the item grew to 40px and the two diverged, at 2.65 spread against 0.50 for the same markup wider.',
      '**AND TWO CONTROLS ARE EXCLUDED FROM IT, WHICH IS WHERE THIS RULE GETS BROKEN.** The rule says "the label beside it", so a control with no label is not in it. An ICON-ONLY control has no text, so there is no cap line and no baseline to sit between: it centres on its own BOX, both axes. A SELECT TRIGGER puts its chevron at the far end of a row that sets its own alignment, and centres on its box too. Write the rule so it cannot reach them — a `:not(.icon-only):not(.select-trigger)` on the selector — because a builder that applies it to everything gets the fault silently. Measured on a generated dashboard: a lightbulb in a 36px square button sat 8.25px above the button\'s centre, and the reader called the icon broken without being able to say why.',
      '**Do not correct individual glyphs.** An icon set spans its glyphs deliberately: measured in one 12px box, a plus paints 8px of ink, a magnifier 10px and a chevron 4px. That variation is the set’s optical balance. Scaling each glyph to a common ink height destroys it and leaves a table of per-glyph numbers nobody can maintain. Fix the size token and the alignment rule; leave the drawings alone.',
      '**ANY RULE THAT RESTATES A BUTTON’S SIZE MUST RESTATE ITS ICON.** This is where the pairing breaks in practice, and it broke twice in one system. A touch-width rule promoted header buttons to the large step — height, leading, padding and label — and left the mark on the small one: a 44px button carrying a 16px label and a 10px icon. A navigation call-to-action was promoted to match the links beside it, kept the small size class in its markup, and did the same. Height, padding, label and mark are one decision, so they live in one block. Anything added to such a selector list belongs in every declaration it carries.',      '**An icon-only control is SQUARE — one to one, at every size step.** An oblong reads as a button whose label failed to load. State it with `aspect-ratio: 1` and `padding: 0` rather than a width per size, so a new step in the scale cannot leave the shape behind.',
      '**A control whose label is HIDDEN is icon-only too, and CSS cannot see that.** A selector cannot ask whether a child is rendered, so a label hidden by a media query leaves the markup unchanged and the icon-only class never arrives — measured at 46x28 and 70x44 on a menu button. Put the square in the same rule block that hides the label, because they are one decision. Then assert it outside CSS: walk the descendants, ask what the engine renders, and fail any pressable thing that has a mark, no visible words and two different sides.',
      '**A tab strip that does not fit becomes a dropdown.** Replace the bar rather than shrinking it or bolting a scrollbar onto it: a run of destinations that does not fit is a list, and a list you pick from is a select. Give the select the tab\'s font size, its padding and its box height, so the value keeps the strip\'s baseline and the content below does not jump when the swap happens. A native select ignores `line-height` on its value, so the parity comes from the box and never from the leading. Keep both in the markup and let CSS show one, or the rule cannot work in a page with no script.',
      'A **tab strip scrolls, it never wraps.** A nav is one line of destinations, and the strip\'s shape is what says so. Folded to two rows it stops reading as one control, and the marker on row two looks like a different thing: measured at 92px tall over two rows for four tabs in a 248px pane. Give the strip `overflow-x: auto` and `flex-wrap: nowrap`, and hide the scrollbar where a second strip sits beside it — a bar takes 10px of height from one strip and not the other, so the two stop agreeing.',
      'A selected **nav item** is a different component and a different answer: a tinted fill, never an underline. It marks the current place in a list, where a fill is what reads as "you are here"; a tab marks the active view in a row.

         weight. The collision is fixed, and the rule outlived its cause:
         three `border` rules stacked in 43px of chrome read as harsh, and the
         same layout with `border-subtle` reads as considered. */
      '`var(--c-border-subtle)` draws every line that divides. A title bar\'s lower edge, the rule under a tab strip, a card\'s edge, a rule between rows: one weight across the whole interface, so a reader learns it once. Space, not weight, says how big a boundary is — a heavier line for a more important division reads as harshness rather than as hierarchy.',
      '`var(--c-border)` is not a divider. It is the outline of a control — an input, a secondary button, anything whose edge tells you where you may click. It is heavier on purpose, and using it for a rule between sections is the most common way a calm layout turns noisy.',
      'Never stack two rules of the same weight close together. Three of them inside 43px of chrome say one boundary three times, and repetition reads as noise. If two lines land near each other, one of them is doing a job that space should do.',
      'A **gutter between columns is a step of its own**, never the row\'s default.

      '**Split a row by what each side holds, not down the middle.** A column with three tiles against a column with one card came 4.4px short at an even-handed 46 to 54, so the tiles wrapped two-and-one at every width.

      '**MEASURE THE SIDE THAT CANNOT SHRINK, AND A TABLE IS ALWAYS THAT SIDE.** A run of tiles wraps when its share runs short, which is untidy. A table SCROLLS, which hides columns, and a scrollbar under a table on a wide desktop reads as a broken page rather than a narrow one. Measured on a generated dashboard at a 1400px viewport: a seven-column table needing 774px was given three fifths of the content column, came out 628px, and cut 146px off its last two columns with a rail still on screen and room to spare beside it. Take the table\'s own min-content width, add the padding between it and the split, and give that side at least this much. Where no share can hold it, the split is the wrong structure for that width and the context column belongs underneath. That floor is a MEASUREMENT, so no token can hold it: put it in a custom property of your own beside the grid that reads it, state the sum it came from in a comment, and keep it on the space grid.',
      '`flex: 1` with `min-width: 0` lets a box **shrink under its own label**. Three tiles cut their headings to fit — 73px of word in a 34px box — and no check calls that an overflow, because nothing left the box.

A segmented control built that way stood 34px beside a 36px select — and because the row centres its children, two boxes of different heights MUST have different tops, so it sat 1px low and read as a misalignment. Nothing was misaligned. The row was holding two heights. State the height on the box, give its inner buttons `align-items: stretch` and `height: 100%`, and the offset cannot occur.',

Use the icon set, at the size token for that control\'s step, with the icon-gap token between it and the words.',

Put `margin-top: auto` on the action row, which takes the free space in a flex column and lands the action on the bottom wherever the text above it ends.

Measured twice on the same rule — a card that was not a stack subtracted a 16px gap it never had and its action row halved to 8px, then a modal footer did the same and measured 11.7 where every card measured 24.

In light a slightly darker tinted band is the conventional marked row and it reads correctly. In dark the same step moves the row toward the page rather than toward the reader, so it reads as a hole with a coloured label floating in it. Where the mark has to work in dark, carry it on the LIGHTNESS instead: step up to `surface-raised`, which is +3.1 in light and +7.8 in dark, and let the label take full-strength `text`.',
      '**A GROUND MAY BE QUIET. A FILLED SHAPE MAY NOT.** `accent-subtle` is the tint behind accent-coloured TEXT, and the words carry the contrast, so the fill may sit close to the card. An avatar disc, a status dot or a tinted square has no words to carry it. Its own fill is the whole signal, and under about 1.2:1 against the ground the shape is absent rather than subtle. Measured here against the card: 1.13:1 in light and 1.11:1 in dark, so an avatar drawn in it vanished in both modes and only its initials floated. No accent STEP repairs it, because a step near the middle of the ramp carries the ramp\'s full chroma and reads as a solid button. Use `accent-raised`, which mixes the accent into the raised surface and clears the floor in both modes, and put `text` on it rather than `accent`.',
      '**AND THE EDGE COSTS A GUTTER, WHICH EVERY ROW IN THE SET RESERVES.** A bar drawn inside the row eats whatever is at that inset, so the content has to clear it. **Never a border**, whichever mechanism you pick: a border widens the row by its own width, so the selected row alone would sit at a different inset.\n\n**WHICH MECHANISM DEPENDS ON WHETHER A RULE CROSSES THE ROW.** Where nothing does — a nav item, a card in a list — an inset `box-shadow` is right and costs no extra element. Where a rule DOES cross, as in every table row with a bottom hairline, an inset shadow is wrong: the border paints on top of it, so the bar stops one hairline short at each boundary. Measured here on a 57px row: the bar painted 56. It then reads as a dash between the rules rather than as the row\'s own edge, and a run of two selected rows shows the break twice.\n\nIn a ruled set the bar is a **pseudo-element**, stretched one hairline past each end so it overlaps the rule above and below. Nothing else can: a background is clipped to the border box and the border still covers it, and an outline draws on all four sides. Two adjacent selected rows then meet with no seam, which is correct — they are one selection.\n\n```css\n.table tr.is-selected > td:first-child { position: relative; }\n.table tr.is-selected > td:first-child::before {\n  content: ""; position: absolute;\n  inset-block: calc(-1 * var(--border-hairline));\n  inset-inline-start: 0;\n  width: var(--cmp-table-row-selected-edge-width);\n  background: var(--cmp-table-row-selected-edge-color);\n}\n```\n\n**The gutter belongs to the BASE padding, never to the selected state.** Adding the bar to the selected row alone is arithmetically right and it staggers the column: measured on a 4px bar, a nav list of five had its selected label at 693 and its four siblings at 689. So `nav-item` and `table-selection-cell` carry the gutter in their own padding, every row takes it, and `nav-item-selected` and `table-row-selected` state no padding at all. The bar then paints into space that is already there.\n\n**A gutter is the bar plus a STEP, not the bar plus whatever is left.** Where the first thing in the row is a label, the component\'s own inset is enough. Where it is an ORNAMENT the step is bigger: a table\'s selection column holds a 16px checkbox, and at the small step the box and the bar read as touching. Both are the accent, so they fused into one shape. `table-selection-cell` clears it by the `lg` step. **Each component also publishes `edge-width`**, the bar alone, for a build that sets its own inset.',
      '**ONE TREATMENT FOR EVERY SELECTED ROW, AND EACH KEEPS ITS OWN INSET.** A nav item marked by a lifted surface, beside a table row marked by an accent wash, reads as two products rather than one system. So the fill and the label colour are the same in both. The INSET is not: a nav item is padded by `sm` and a table cell by `md`, so the two edge compensations differ and the emitted values say so. Read `nav-item-selected` and `table-row-selected` together, and give any other selectable row you build the same fill with its own base padding.',
      'A collapsed row still costs its line gap. An element held at `max-height: 0` is still on a flex line, and the container charges the row gap whether or not anything is in it.

Where a row opens and closes, give it the whole spacing as its own animated margin and set the container\'s `row-gap` to zero.

      'State an alignment on the element that must hold it, never leave it to a neighbour. A header\'s actions sat against the END edge only because a group beside them carried `flex: 1` — and that group is hidden at narrow widths, so the actions packed left with 226px of empty bar beside them. Put `margin-inline-start: auto` on the group that belongs at the end. Where the flexible neighbour does render it takes the free space first and the margin resolves to zero, so one rule covers every width.',

If you trim, re-tune the spacing scale in the same edit. The old values were chosen with the leading in them, and trimming alone tightens every stack at once.',

Where none does — a row-selection box in a table — the CELL carries the target, and the selection column widens to the declared minimum instead of staying at the box\'s own width.

    '**A STAT TILE TAKES THE BASE CARD, NOT THE COMPACT ONE.** The compact variant exists for a card inside another card, or a card in a list of many. A tile carrying one figure is the card the system was designed around, so it takes the base padding. Measured at the densest setting on offer: the base card gives 16px and the compact variant 12px, and 12px around a heading, a large figure and a delta reads as cramped. The variant is a decision about CONTEXT rather than about size, so pick it from where the card sits.',
    '**THE THREE STATES SHARE ONE CELL.** Two of them draw a mark, and in normal flow two marks lay out SIDE BY SIDE. Measured: two 14px marks in a 14px content box overflowed it by 6px and 8px and were clipped, so the checked box showed the right-hand half of its tick, which is the long diagonal, and read as a slash rather than a tick. `opacity: 0` on the other mark reclaims nothing, because an invisible flex item still takes its share of the line. Put every state at `grid-area: 1 / 1` in a grid box, or position them absolutely.',
    '**GIVE THE TICK THE BOX, AND LEAVE THE DRAWING ALONE.** An icon set centres its glyph in a square viewBox with margin around it, so a check occupying 16 by 11 of a 24 box spends two thirds of your control on nothing. Rendered at 12px that came to 8.0 by 5.5 with a 2.5px short leg, which no reader sees as a tick. Crop the viewBox to the glyph own bounding box plus a unit of margin. The box is yours to choose and the ink inside it is the library, so this is a sizing decision rather than a redrawing.',
    '**A CHIP CENTRES ITS LABEL WITH A STATED LINE BOX, NOT WITH PADDING.** A line box reserves descender room that capitals never use, so equal padding above and below still leaves the ink high. Measured on four badges: 7px above the ink against 8.72 below, for 1.71px of visible lift on a 25px chip. State a height and a `line-height` equal to it, and put the horizontal inset in `padding-inline`.',
    'A checkbox has **three** states, not two. Indeterminate is the only honest answer for a select-all box when some of the rows below it are selected and some are not — unchecked claims nothing is selected while rows plainly are, and checked claims everything is. Distinguish it by the MARK, a dash against a tick, never by the fill alone: a reader who cannot separate the two hues still sees two shapes.',

    /* The rule above says what a checkbox LOOKS like in each state and never
       said what tells the reader which one they are selecting. So a build put
       bare boxes in a table and bare boxes in a form, and only one of those is
       a legitimate pattern. */
    'A checkbox carries a visible label. There are exactly four exceptions, and every one of them is a case where the label is POSITIONAL — supplied by the structure the box sits in rather than by text beside it. A row-selection box is named by the column heading together with its own row. A select-all in the header cell is named by its column, so it needs a name of its own and does not inherit the rows\'. A box inside a card or a tile is named by that card\'s heading. A box in a matrix cell is named by its row label and its column heading together. Everywhere else, visible text sits beside the box. An icon-only box in a toolbar is not an exception to this: it is a toggle button, which is a different component.',
    'A positional label still owes an accessible NAME, and these are two separate questions. A selection column is right to carry no visible text and wrong to carry no `aria-label`. Name each row\'s box for the record it selects, using that row\'s own identifier rather than "Select row", and give the select-all a name of its own. A `<label>` element that wraps no control and carries no `for` names nothing, whatever text sits inside it.',

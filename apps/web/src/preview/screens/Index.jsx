/* An index: a list you work in.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE. Across the other ten surfaces there was no search field, no
 * filter in its set state, no checkbox column, no sortable header, no
 * selection, and no pagination. That is six components an agent has to invent,
 * on the single most common screen in software after a dashboard. It was found
 * by drawing the screen rather than by listing components — see the comps in
 * the session notes.
 *
 * WHAT DRAWING IT FOUND, before a line of this file existed:
 *   · figures had no stated treatment, so a column of money would not align
 *   · the checkbox had two states and needed three
 *   · a selected row had no role, and `accent-subtle` measures 1.26:1 — a
 *     selection you can only see once you are already looking at it
 *   · a striped row had no role either
 *   · `border` was measured on `surface` alone, its best case, so a control on
 *     any darker ground had an outline nobody had checked
 *
 * THE TABLE IS CARBON'S, ON OUR RAMP. Its header row and its zebra row are the
 * same step off the surface; it keeps the row rules as well as the stripe; and
 * its selection is neutral, with the accent appearing once per row rather than
 * filling it. All three were things this file got wrong first.
